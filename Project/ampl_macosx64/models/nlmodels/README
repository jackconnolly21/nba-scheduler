This directory contains a collection of test problems for nonlinear
programming expressed as AMPL models (the *.mod files).  Many are for
a fixed problem size and contain a data section.  Some are pure model
files describing families of problems, with default values that specify
a small instance; such models are noted with "V" in the classification
table below.

Comments in the *.mod files give the problem sources (original sources
or test-problem collections).  Many of the problems were selected and
coded in AMPL by Elena Bobrovnikova (at Bell Labs in the summer of
1996), with some subsequent editing by David M. Gay; these problems
contain the comment
# Original AMPL coding by Elena Bobrovnikova (summer 1996 at Bell Labs).

Each problem is classified as in the CUTE collection of test problems,
except that problems with a V code for the number of variables or
constraints have the default value for that number after the V.
The classification is a string of the form

	OCSD-KI-n-m

in which the letters are replaced by appropriate codes, as follows:

O = objective code:
	C = Constant
	L = Linear
	N = No objective
	Q = Quadratic
	S = Sum of squares
	O = Other (none of the above)

C = constraint type:
	B = Bounds on variables
	L = Linear
	N = linear Network
	Q = Quadratic
	U = Unconstrained
	X = just fiXed variables
	O = Other (none of the above)

S = smoothness:
	R = Twice continuously differentiable
	I = Other

D = degree of available derivatives: always 2 here; 0, 1, or 2 in general

K = kind of the problem:
	A = Academic
	M = Modeling
	R = Real application

I = internal variables:
	Y = yes, problems has useful internal variables
	N = no useful internal variables

n = number of variables; V = varies (followed by default)

m = number of constraints; V = varies (followed by default)
