Some general stuff TODO:
1) Figure out the best way to make the cost function, that optimizes
in the proper way we want
  --> Maybe add other factors too such as:
    > 4 in 5 sets
    > not sure what else
2) Make some cool plots of gradientDescent vs stochasticGradDesc
  --> For different values of stuff? Averages? As it runs?
3) Let's get another way of optimization --> formulate as linear system
like Brian said?
