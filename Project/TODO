Some general stuff TODO:
1) Create an initialize method that gives us random,
consistent initialization to run local search on
2) Create some kind of swap function that can take two
games between teams and move them around (or maybe just one
game at a time and move to a different date?)
3) Decide how we do local search

Useful stuff:
1) Find csv of the actual NBA schedule and somehow
load that in so we can do some testing of helper methods
2) Test the helper methods
3) Function that checks if set of schedules is valid
