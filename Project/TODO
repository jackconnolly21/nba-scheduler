Some general stuff TODO: (in this order?)

1) Make some cool plots of gradientDescent vs stochasticGradDesc
  --> For different values of stuff? Averages? As it runs?
  --> Use whatever you used in SA pset, that was cool

2) Figure out the best way to make the cost function, that optimizes
in the proper way we want
  --> Maybe add other factors too such as:
  --> 4 in 5 sets
  --> not sure what else
  a) Somehow account for variance in the cost function:
    --> i.e. reward a solution where all teams have equal
        # of btb vs one team having way more than another

3) Let's get another way of optimization --> formulate as linear system
like Brian said?

4) Time things in the gradientDescent and stochasticGradDesc methods and
see what's taking a long time and if we can cut that down if possible
  --> basically used like:
          from timeit import default_timer as timer
          start = timer()
          piece of code you want to time
          end = timer()
          print "Total execution time:", end - start
  (a) Another way to do this would be making some kind of heuristic for
      which swaps we do, maybe most back to backs/triples, highest travel
      distance or something, so we have less wasted swaps
